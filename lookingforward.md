# Looking Forward
As I move forward, I’m excited to carry the work we’ve done in this class into new opportunities for learning and growth. Here’s how I plan to do that:

## Return to Education Commons: 
I want to spend more time at the Education Commons and experiment further with the tools we used during our projects. The laser cutter was fun to use and I’m eager to explore how hands-on making can complement and expand digital research.

## Challenge Myself to Code More: 
I’ve realized the importance of coding in making ideas tangible. I will look into more coding classes at Penn to learn about more languages. I find coding pretty intimidating but I also want to push myself out of my comfort zone!

## Enroll in "Data Science for the Humanities": 
This course feels like the natural next step for me. Also, it is the only class I have to take in order to complete the minor!

## Expand My Reading: 
I want to read more about the intersection of technology and the humanities. There’s so much to learn from exploring how these fields overlap and influence one another. I don't think I read enough to begin with so I will start small to build up to reading about more copmlex topics. A good start might be thinking more deeply about the readings I see in my classes!
