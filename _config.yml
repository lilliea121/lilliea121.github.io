description: Here is a portfolio of what I've been up to in my Digital Humanities Class!

Throughout this semester, I worked on a diverse range of projects that introduced me to the multifaceted world of digital humanities. These projects combined technology, creativity, and critical thinking, pushing me to engage with tools and methods that initially felt daunting. If you had asked me in August to explain what digital humanities entailed, I would have struggled to offer a coherent answer. Back then, I might have guessed it involved digitizing old books or using software to analyze text. My understanding of the field’s scope or significance was limited.

As a lifelong creative and learner, I have always sought opportunities to expand my understanding of the world and integrate new skills into my personal and professional pursuits. Now, after immersing myself in this course, I see digital humanities as a space where technology and human curiosity intersect. This intersection reshaped my understanding of how knowledge is spread and interpreted. Along the way, I explored new computational tools, approaches to data, and hands-on techniques for making. These experiences feel deeply relevant to my academic interests and my broader fascination in our fast-paced digital world.

One recurring theme in our class was the complex relationship between physical objects and their digital counterparts. This theme made common appearances in our readings, especially in Prof. Trettian’s Material/Digital. Trettian argues that digital iterations of tangible objects are distinct creations rather than mere replicas. This perspective was relevant during our laser-cut visualization project for The Umpire. The project transformed abstract data into a physical object using reflective acrylic. The iridescent qualities of the material symbolized the introspective connection many incarcerated individuals had with faith at Eastern State. The process prompted us to think critically about how digitization reshapes meaning and how choices in representation can affect interpretation. This project also introduced me to Penn’s Education Commons, a resource I hope to use in future projects!

Another important theme was the integrity of data and the responsibility to ensure that digitization does not obscure or misrepresent the voices and intentions of original creators. This theme emerged in Jon Bouk’s Democracy’s Data, which explores how datasets like the U.S. Census reflect biases and power dynamics. Bouk’s analysis encouraged me to scrutinize the origins and purposes of data critically. This perspective was reinforced during the OpenRefine workshop hosted by Penn Libraries. The workshop emphasized thoughtful, intentional data cleaning that respects a dataset’s complexity and narrative. I saw connections between this workshop and Rawson’s Against Cleaning. This piece expanded on the themes represented in the workshop by challenging conventional notions of “clean” data, advocating instead for preserving its messiness to honor its integrity and the context it represents.

We also investigated the implications of digitization methods. As Material/Digital emphasized, digitization is not a neutral act. The processes chosen to digitize material texts shape and, at times, distort their representation. Dorothy Berry’s lecture illuminated how digital archives can amplify historical voices while simultaneously risking the erasure of archivists’ labor and intentions. Berry’s insights reinforced the importance of respecting the labor behind digital projects and treating archives as intentionally curated spaces rather than static reproductions.

Preserving and amplifying historical voices became a cornerstone of our class projects. Whether through digitally fabricated data visualizations or multimedia essays, our work sought to respect the humanity embedded in the data. My multimedia essay focuses on Jane Gates’ philanthropy, highlighting the transformative contributions she made to Eastern State Penitentiary while amplifying the voices of incarcerated individuals. This project showcased the power of digital tools to link historical narratives with modern audiences, giving marginalized voices a platform to connect with today's world. It also highlighted the importance of approaching sensitive information, especially concerning the deceased, with thoughtfulness and respect.

The workshops I attended deepened my understanding of how various methods fit within the broader framework of digital humanities. Initially, I struggled to see connections between the OpenRefine session and the audio recording workshop. However, both emphasized the human-centered nature of digital work. The OpenRefine workshop stressed the importance of collaboration and intentionality in data cleaning, while the audio workshop highlighted sound’s potential as a storytelling medium. Experimenting with microphones and the software Audacity gave me a new appreciation for the role of sound in preserving and sharing narratives. These hands-on experiences paralleled material from class on the multifaceted nature of archives and the ethical considerations surrounding preservation.

In addition to the workshops, I had the opportunity to attend Dorothy Berry’s lecture about digital archives. This added another layer to these ideas by examining the often-invisible labor behind digital archives. Her reflections reminded me that digital platforms frequently hide the physical and intellectual effort required for curation. Her perspectives encouraged me to approach digital archives as intentionally designed artifacts, shaped by choices that deserve recognition and respect.

Before this course, I viewed digital humanities as primarily a computational and data-driven field. However, I now see it as a deeply interdisciplinary domain that brings together unexpected topics. My multimedia essay on Jane Gates exemplified this shift in perspective. Through this project, I explored digital research platforms and learned how they amplify marginalized voices while addressing ethical challenges in representation. Gates’ story demonstrated the human dimension of digital humanities, showing how these tools can connect past injustices to modern audiences and foster understanding.

Reflecting on my work, I am proud of how I embraced unfamiliar tools and concepts. The laser-cut project, for instance, pushed me to think critically about design and fabrication while honoring the narratives embedded in the data. Yet, there are areas for improvement. Time constraints limited our ability to refine the physical assembly of our project, leaving room for technical enhancements. Similarly, while my multimedia essay effectively highlighted Gates’ humanity, experimenting with different markdown techniques could have further enriched the presentation.

This semester affirmed my passion for storytelling, a common theme that runs through all my projects and reflections. The definition of storytelling was expanded into digital mediums that required creativity and critical thinking. The course taught me to view digital tools as platforms for sharing human experiences.

Digital humanities serves as a link between technology and human experience. This field deserves more attention, as it fosters a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical stories embedded in data. From preserving historical voices to ethically managing data and crafting meaningful visualizations, the field highlights the need for both empathy and deliberate care in every aspect of its work.

Looking ahead, I am excited to carry the skills I developed this semester into future projects. I have no doubt that my new mindset and skills will shape my academic and professional pursuits. As I continue to explore new tools and methods, I hope to deepen my understanding of storytelling and contribute meaningfully to the evolving field of digital humanities.
