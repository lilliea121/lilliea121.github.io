On October 8, I attended Lauren Phegley’s workshop, “Data Cleaning Using OpenRefine,” hosted by Penn Libraries. The workshop was both interesting and super relevant to key aspects of Digital Humanities. Before attending, I had minimal knowledge of both data cleaning and the OpenRefine software. Lauren provided a clear and thorough explanation of OpenRefine’s capabilities, emphasizing its versatility as a data-cleaning tool that doesn’t require knowledge of coding languages like Python. For someone like me, who is still building confidence with Python and R in general, OpenRefine offers an accessible and powerful alternative that I can see myself potentially using in future projects. The hands-on approach demonstrated during the session made the tool feel even more approachable and practical for real-world applications.
The workshop resonated strongly with concepts from our coursework, particularly the reading “Against Cleaning” by Rawson and Muñoz. This reading explores the complexities of data cleaning, challenging the simplistic view that it’s just about eliminating messiness. It encourages users to consider the integrity and richness of data rather than erasing its complexity. This perspective would be crucial for anyone attending the workshop, helping them approach OpenRefine thoughtfully and avoid unintentional data loss or oversimplification. The reading added depth to my understanding of data cleaning by emphasizing that preserving the unique characteristics of a dataset can often be as important as organizing it.
Interestingly, while OpenRefine is introduced as a tool to clean and format data, implying that “messiness” should be removed, it also embodies many of the principles discussed in “Against Cleaning”. The software’s design centers on human decision-making, aligning with the article’s emphasis on understanding and preserving data richness rather than altering or reducing it. OpenRefine allows users to critically engage with the cleaning process, prompting reflection on what changes are truly necessary and how they might impact the dataset’s meaning. This encourages a more thoughtful approach to data cleaning, where each adjustment is intentional.
The article also highlights the dangers of scaling up data cleaning without considering its consequences. OpenRefine aligns with this caution by balancing scalability with the need to retain the unique details within datasets, giving users opportunities to make deliberate, informed choices throughout the cleaning process. OpenRefine’s features give users control over what is standardized and what remains unique, providing tools to counter the risks associated with overly broad or automated cleaning processes. This balance between scalability and meticulousness makes it a valuable resource for anyone working with complex datasets.
One of the most significant features I found is the group collaboration feature. This feature was also applicable to discussions we’ve had in class. This allows multiple people to work together on cleaning data, sharing insights about organization and cleaning methods. In “Against Cleaning”, the authors emphasize the importance of communities that care about the data and highlight how critical human judgment is throughout the data cleaning process. This feature of OpenRefine supports the collaborative aspect discussed in the reading by enabling teamwork and diverse perspectives in the cleaning process. 
If anything, the workshop demonstrated the capabilities of OpenRefine and allowed me to approach it with the mentality shaped by the article. The article emphasizes that data cleaning shouldn’t be a mindless process. It requires a full understanding of the data and a nuanced, collaborative approach to organizing and formatting it. The overlaps between the workshop and the article have given me a deeper appreciation for how tools like OpenRefine can empower users to engage thoughtfully and responsibly with data. I’m grateful I chose to participate in this workshop in particular because it allowed me to gain a new skill while also incorporating values I learned from this class.
